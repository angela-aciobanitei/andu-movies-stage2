# Popular Movies Stage II

Expand on the movies app built in the previous project (Popular Movies Stage I) to create a fully-featured app that will allow users to view and play trailers, read reviews, and mark their favorite movies.

## Project Specs
*   Movies are displayed via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
*   When user taps a movie poster, the movie details are shown: title, release date, poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
*   The movie details screen also contains a section for displaying trailer videos and user reviews.
*   The user can toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated, and now playing.
*   Users can mark their favorite movies and share the movie trailerâ€™s YouTube URLs.
*   The favorite movies are stored in a local database, and can be displaedy even when offline.

*   Gradually load information on demand from a data source with [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/).
*   Use [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)'s capabilities for data persistence.
*   Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way with [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel). 
*   Bind observable data to UI elements with [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/).
